        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>
                Born in July 1998, I'm told that I have been an artist since my early childhood. I have vague memories of me 
                drawing on every surface I could find, which later developed into drawing specific characters in stories that I'd come up with every once in a while.
                It is only in 2019 that I began to take art seriously. I was in the middle of my engineering studies when I got my first digital tablet
                and determined to pursue art more seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the next few years I saw immense improvement in my drawing skills as I continued to practice with different mediums and concepts. I joined
                a couple of art exhibitions organized by clubs in my university and met more artists than I expected to see in an engineering environment.
                After I graduated in 2021, I took a much needed break from science but never from art. I frequently posted my drawings on social media and accumulated
                enough pieces to submit a portfolio to the art school of Oran in September of 2022. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After my admission to the first year class of 2022/2023, I ended up learning and discovering more about my artistic process. I tried things and 
                experimented with ideas that I'd never entertained before. I improved as an artist and as a person thanks to the amazing friends and classmates that I was
                fortunate enough to meet during my one year of studies at the school, after which my journey abruptly ended due to personal reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now in 2024 I remain ever more adamant to pursue my artistic path and uncover worlds of wonders through physical and spiritual expression presented in the form of 
                visual art that conveys feelings and ideologies to all corners of the world without limits or discrimination.
            </p>
